  "Prompt": "A dark and foreboding underground sci-fi landscape stretches out with jagged, rocky terrain and treacherous crevices. Skeletal remains of massive alien creatures litter the area, partially obscured by thick, swirling mists. Alien machinery with glowing, eerie green lights hums ominously, half-buried in the ground, and flickers sporadically, casting unsettling shadows. Strange, bioluminescent fungi and alien plants with luminescent blue and purple hues dot the environment, providing minimal light. The atmosphere is dense with green-tinted fog, hinting at toxic gases, and strange, menacing silhouettes loom in the distance.\n\nIn the background, towering, dark structures vaguely resembling ancient alien ruins are barely visible through the dense mist. The sky above is not visible, with the entire scene bathed in an oppressive, muted color palette of dark greys, greens, and purples. Underground rivers of iridescent, glowing liquid snake through the landscape, illuminating the surroundings in a ghostly manner. The presence of giant, shadowy alien predators can be sensed lurking just beyond the view, instilling a sense of fear and danger. The flat-shaded 3D digital art style, with bold lines and minimal details, emphasizes the menacing simplicity of the environment, creating a visually striking and eerie scene.
