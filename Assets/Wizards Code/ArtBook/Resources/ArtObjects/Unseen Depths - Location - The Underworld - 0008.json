  "Prompt": "a dark, foreboding underworld with twisted metallic structures and eerie fluorescent lights. The environment is a sprawling labyrinth of alien machinery, with pipes, wires, and glowing consoles. The primary colors are dark and muted, with hints of red, orange, and yellow illuminating the machines and some textiles. The terrain is uneven and rocky, with shadows creating an oppressive atmosphere. Sinister robotic creatures patrol the area, their eyes glowing menacingly. The limited lighting casts long, dark shadows, obscuring much of the surroundings and adding to the tension. The art style is simple, flat shaded 3D with bold lines and minimal detail, focusing on silhouettes and color contrast. The overall feeling is one of fear and danger, with the unknown lurking in the dark corners.
