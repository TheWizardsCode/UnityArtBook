  "Prompt": "A vast, sprawling subterranean city illuminated by bioluminescent lamps resembling alien flora casts an eerie glow amidst the darkness. Jagged, metallic buildings rise like the twisted remnants of a forgotten world. Caverns and tunnels, whose depths are shrouded in shadow, connect various parts of the city. Roaming amidst the structures are humanoid figures with glowing eyes and cybernetic augmentations, their forms partially obscured by the darkness. High above, massive, rotating machinery hangs from the cavern ceiling, providing an oppressive sense of scale. The sky is a ceiling of steel and rock interspersed with pipes and vents emitting a faint, ominous vapor. In the foreground, a narrow bridge made of rusted metal and illuminated with dim, flickering lights stretches across a bottomless chasm. The sense of foreboding is heightened by intermittent flashes of sparks and electrical surges that reveal larger structures in the distance, engulfed by shadows. The flat-shaded 3D digital art style, with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizes the stark contrasts and eerie simplicity of this high-quality, high-resolution sci-fi underworld scene.\n\nTags: Non-Anime, Original, 3D, dark_shadows, minimal_detail, bioluminescent_lights, cyberpunk, subterranean_city, eerie, cybernetic, machinery, oppressive, rusted_metal, flickering_lights, ominous",
