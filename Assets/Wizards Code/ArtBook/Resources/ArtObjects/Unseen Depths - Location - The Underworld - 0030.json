  "Prompt": "A sprawling sci-fi underworld stretches out before the viewer, a labyrinthine network of colossal, industrial structures interwoven with advanced alien technology. The landscape is dominated by a looming, ominous skyline of rusted metallic towers and conduits illuminated faintly by the eerie glow of neon blue and green lights emanating from embedded circuits. The ground level is shrouded in shadows and mist, adding to the sense of mystery and peril. Dark, foreboding passageways and cavernous chambers hint at dangers lurking within, with occasional glimpses of cybernetic creatures patrolling the area. The lighting is sparse and strategic, casting long, dark shadows and leaving significant portions of the scene unseen, amplifying the fear of the unknown. The image features a simple flat-shaded 3D style with bold, clean lines and minimal details, focusing on the silhouette and shape to convey an atmosphere of impending doom.
