  "Prompt": "The underworld scene is filled with jagged, mechanical structures and eerie glowing machinery. Picture a vast, subterranean landscape composed of interconnected platforms and walkways, suspended over an abyss. These platforms are made of dark metal, with intricate patterns and sharp edges that shimmer under low lighting. Ominous, red-lit screens and glowing orange cables snake around the environment, pulsing with an unknown energy source. Some areas are bathed in harsh, yellow spotlights, creating stark contrasts to the dark shadows that engulf most of the scene.\n\nThe walls and structures are adorned with unsettling, robotic appendages that seem to watch intruders, their movements subtle but menacing. In the background, you can hear the constant hum and clank of machinery, adding to the sense of isolation and danger. The ceiling above is barely visible, shrouded in darkness, with occasional sparks flying from malfunctioning equipment. \n\nThe protagonist can be seen cautiously moving through this hazardous environment, wearing a sleek, high-tech exosuit with illuminated accents in red and orange. They carry a futuristic weapon, ready to face whatever dangers lurk in the shadows. The style of the artwork features bold, flat shading and clean, minimal details, enhancing the sense of fear and unease while highlighting the striking colors of the advanced technology. \n\nGelbooru tags: [sci-fi], [mechanical], [futuristic], [glowing], [dark], [dangerous], [3D], [bold lines], [minimal detail], [flat shading], [high-tech].",
