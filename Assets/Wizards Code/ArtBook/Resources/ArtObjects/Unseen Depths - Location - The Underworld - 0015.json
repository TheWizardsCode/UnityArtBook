  "Prompt": "The Underworld features a dark, menacing sci-fi environment. A subterranean landscape of twisted, biomechanical structures sprawls out before the viewer, blending organic shapes with cold, metallic textures. Gigantic, ominous machinery extends from the cavernous walls, shimmering with dim, eerie green and blue luminescence. The lighting levels are meticulously low, creating deep, inky shadows that obscure the labyrinthine pathways and hint at unseen dangers lurking within. The ground is uneven and scarred, a testament to years of mechanical erosion and neglect. Various vents and pipes crisscross above, emitting intermittent bursts of steam and flickering lights, adding to the overall sense of fear and foreboding. The scene exudes a sense of claustrophobia, enveloping the viewer in an oppressive atmosphere. All elements are depicted using simple, flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark, isolative nature of the Underworld. High-quality rendering ensures every aspect – from the texture of the metallic structures to the eerie glowing lights – is captured with striking clarity.
