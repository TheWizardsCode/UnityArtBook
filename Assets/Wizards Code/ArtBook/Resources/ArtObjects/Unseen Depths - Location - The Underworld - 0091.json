  "Prompt": "A dark and ominous landscape in the underworld, featuring jagged rock formations and eerie bioluminescent flora casting a ghostly glow. The terrain is rugged, with irregular chasms and lava pools creating an inhospitable environment. In the foreground, a futuristic, battle-worn explorer in a high-tech exosuit cautiously navigates the perilous ground, their helmet's visor reflecting the bleak surroundings. Above, the sky is a swirling vortex of dark clouds and electric storms, adding to the sense of impending danger. The architecture subtly integrated into the cliffs suggests an ancient, abandoned civilization with futuristic technology. The lighting is dim, and the heavy shadows obscure much of the surrounding area, creating a sense of mystery and unseen threats lurking in the darkness. The flat shaded 3D digital art style employs bold lines and minimal detail, enhancing the sense of foreboding and unease.
