  "Prompt": "A dark, sci-fi underworld environment filled with complex machinery and eerie shadows. The image depicts a vast underground cavern with jagged, rocky walls and a low, foreboding ceiling. The overall lighting level is low, creating deep, impenetrable shadows and mysterious unseen areas. Sharp, bright lights in striking red, orange, and yellow colors illuminate the machinery and textiles scattered throughout the scene, providing stark contrast to the black and gray surroundings.\n\nThe machinery consists of intricate, interconnected pipes, gears, and panels, glowing with pulsating neon lights. Large, ominous generators emit a low hum, casting flickering lights that dance across the walls. There are exposed cables and wires hanging loosely, sparking occasionally with electric blue arcs. The ground is uneven, littered with debris and remnants of what looks like broken androids and discarded tech fragments.\n\nIn the center of the scene, a pathway made of metallic, grated flooring leads to an imposing steel door, half open, revealing more darkness beyond. Shadows of unknown creatures or androids can be seen lurking in the periphery, their forms barely distinguishable within the gloom.\n\nThe air is thick with a sense of danger and foreboding, amplified by the flat shaded 3D digital art style. Bold lines define the chaotic geometry of the underworld, while the minimal detail emphasizes the stark contrast between light and dark, creating a surreal and unsettling atmosphere.",
