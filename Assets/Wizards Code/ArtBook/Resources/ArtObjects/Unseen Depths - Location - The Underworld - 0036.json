  "Prompt": "A vast, haunting cavern stretches out into the darkness, illuminated only by the eerie glow of bioluminescent fungi and neon signs in an alien language. Jagged, twisting rock formations rise from the ground like monstrous fangs, casting ominous shadows that suggest hidden dangers within. In the background, a network of ancient, decaying industrial machinery looms, with pipes and wires snaking into the darkness. Flickering lights reveal fleeting glimpses of alien creatures skittering across the walls. The feel is gritty and industrial, with rusted metals and corroded surfaces adding to the tension. A lone figure stands on a precarious ledge, draped in a high-tech exosuit, scanning the foreboding landscape below with a flickering holographic map. The overall lighting is dim and erratic, casting long, unsettling shadows. Visual elements include sci-fi architecture, dark industrial motifs, bioluminescent flora, and shadowy alien creatures. The imagery employs bold lines and flat, simplified shading to evoke a sense of abstraction and unease while maintaining high visual fidelity and striking detail.
