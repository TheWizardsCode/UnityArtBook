  "Prompt": "A vast, sprawling underworld city with towering, futuristic structures embedded deep into the cavernous earth. The buildings are harshly angular and covered in neon lights, illuminating the dark, rocky environment. The distant ceiling of the cavern is barely visible, shrouded in darkness and giving an oppressive sense of depth. \n\nScattered throughout the scene are advanced alien technologies, many of which are shrouded in darkness and give off an eerie, otherworldly glow. A deep blue and green color scheme dominates, punctuated by the occasional red warning light. Small, robotic drones hover around, casting harsh spotlights and projecting stark shadows, highlighting the minimalistic nature of the environment.\n\nThe streets below are desolate, with broken pathways and glowing green holographic signs in an alien language. The shadows hide numerous dangers, with tendrils of unknown origin starting to emerge from dark crevices. Angular metallic structures and platforms rise haphazardly, creating a maze of sorts. \n\nThe lighting is low and highly directional, creating dramatic, elongated shadows that obscure the true breadth of the structures. Occasional bursts of steam and gas from cracks in the ground add to the sense of instability and danger. \n\nTags: 1girl, black_hair, glowing_eyes, long_hair, dark, mechanical, atmospheric, neon, shadows, fear, danger, sci-fi, minimalistic, futuristic_city, artificial_intelligence, 3d-inspired, flat_shading, dramatic_lighting, cyberpunk.",
