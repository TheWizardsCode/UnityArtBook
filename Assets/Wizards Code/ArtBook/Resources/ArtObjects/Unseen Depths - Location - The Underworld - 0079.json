  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding underworld set in a deep sci-fi universe is visualized. The environment is an expansive subterranean cavern filled with jagged, alien rock formations that glow an eerie bioluminescent green. The cavern floor is uneven, littered with strange, twisted metallic structures partially covered in interstellar moss. Suspended above, massive, segmented pipes and cables dangle ominously, dripping with an unknown viscous substance. Dim, flickering lights embedded in the cavern walls cast long, sinister shadows that hide unseen dangers. In the distance, a massive, ominous industrial complex looms, with platforms connected by precarious, narrow bridges. The air is thick with fog, which distorts and blurs the landscape. Blade Runner vibes, dark shadows, and minimal detail with flat shaded 3D digital art, bold lines, dystopian, eerie, low light, futuristic industrial elements, bioluminescent glow, shadowy figures, dripping pipes, alien underground, digital_art, sci-fi environment.",
