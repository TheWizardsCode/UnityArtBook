  "Prompt": "An ominous sci-fi underworld landscape stretches out, enveloped in darkness with dim, ghostly lights hinting at its vastness. The terrain is jagged, with sharp, alien rock formations jutting out at odd angles, shadowing the paths below in deep, foreboding darkness. The ground is cracked and uneven, with glowing, toxic green and electric blue pools emitting an eerie light, suggesting uninhabitable conditions.\n\nIn the distance, towering spires made of an unknown metallic substance rise from the ground, covered in glowing, circuit-like patterns. Some of these spires are partially collapsed, debris scattered around their bases, adding to the forbidding ambiance. Leading from these spires are bridges and walkways suspended high above the ground, constructed of the same alien metal but looking perilously fragile and unstable.\n\nThere are strange, mechanical creatures lurking in the shadowsâ€”spider-like with elongated limbs and eyes glowing red. They appear half-constructed, wires and mechanical parts visible through their unfinished exteriors, adding to the sense of fear and danger. Occasionally, bright blue electricity arcs between the creatures and the spires, casting brief flashes of light that reveal more dangers hidden in the shadows.\n\nThe low lighting highlights the eerie details without revealing everything, leaving much to the imagination and enhancing the sense of danger and fear. The whole image is created in a flat-shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark contrasts and simplistic terror of the underworld landscape. This combination of eerie lighting, alien terrain, and mechanical monstrosities provides a nightmarish vision of an uncharted and perilous underworld. \n\nTags: 3d art, sci-fi, underworld, alien landscape, toxic pools, metallic spires, mechanical creatures, minimal detail, eerie lighting, dark shadows, bold lines, flat-shaded, fear, danger.",
