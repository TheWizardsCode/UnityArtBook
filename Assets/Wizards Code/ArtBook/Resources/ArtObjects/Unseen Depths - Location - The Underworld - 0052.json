  "Prompt": "A subterranean sci-fi world filled with unknown perils. The environment is an expansive cavern with towering, jagged rock formations. Strange, bioluminescent fungi and alien mosses cast an eerie, dim light in hues of green and purple. The ground is uneven, littered with mechanical debris from ancient civilizations, partially buried in the earth. Biomechanical tentacles snake through the cavern, pulsating with an unnatural glow. Deep, shadowy crevices hide unseen threats, their dark voids creating an air of fear and danger. \n\nA narrow, rickety metal bridge stretches over a bottomless chasm, seeming precariously weak and unstable. Off to the side, a waterfall of unknown liquid plunges into the abyss, emitting a low, foreboding hum. \n\nThe cavern's ceiling is a tangle of stalactites and metallic wires, through which distant, flickering lights hint at more of the Underworld's secrets hidden away. A path of illuminated neon lines winds through the cavern, leading to a large, ominous mechanical gate that hints at a more dangerous area beyond. The entire scene is rendered in flat-shaded 3D digital art style, with bold lines and minimal detail, accentuating the menacing and surreal atmosphere of this underworld. \n\nTags: sci-fi, underworld, subterranean, cavern, biomechanical, bioluminescent, alien flora, mechanical debris, dark shadows, sci-fi architecture, bold lines, minimal detail, fear, danger, low light, eerie atmosphere, 3D digital art.",
