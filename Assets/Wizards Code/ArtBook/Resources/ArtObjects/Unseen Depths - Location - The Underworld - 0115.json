  "Prompt": "The image showcases a sprawling, eerie underworld set in a sci-fi environment. The primary structure is an enormous, futuristic labyrinth made up of dark metallic and obsidian-like materials, reflecting minimal light. Navigating through this maze, you find pathways that twist and turn into darker shadows, filled with unseen and perilous dangers. Surrounding the labyrinth are large, menacing towers that rise from a river of glowing, neon-blue liquid, casting an ominous, diffused light across the scene.\n\nSuspended above, there are massive, circular machines and floating orbs that emit a faint, ghostly green glow, reminiscent of surveillance devices, suggesting constant watch over anyone who dares to venture into this world. The sky above is tinged with smoky, purplish clouds, and occasional shards of harsh red light break through, creating a stark contrast against the overall dark palette. \n\nThe landscape is dotted with skeletal remains of alien creatures and deteriorating, robotic husks, enhancing the sense of lurking danger and the aftermath of previous conflicts. The image employs a minimalistic color scheme with bold lines, primarily focusing on blacks, grays, and occasional bursts of neon colors, enhancing the sense of impending terror and the unknown.\n\nTags: dark_shadows, futuristic, sci-fi, maze, neon_light, eerie, mechanical, surveillance, minimalist, skeletal_remains, alien, robotic, bold_lines, ominous, glowing_liquid, high_quality, dystopian, underworld",
