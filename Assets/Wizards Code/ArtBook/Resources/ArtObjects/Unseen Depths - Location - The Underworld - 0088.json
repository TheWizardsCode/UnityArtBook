  "Prompt": "A vast, eerie underworld landscape stretches out before the viewer. This sci-fi scene is set in a cavernous subterranean realm with tall, jagged rock formations that seem almost unnaturally geometric. The entire area is bathed in a low, eerie bluish-green light that emanates from bioluminescent fungi and crystalline structures embedded within the rocks. Dark shadows cast by the jagged formations create a maze of unseen areas filled with danger.\n\nThe ground is uneven and littered with remnants of broken machinery and ancient ruins, giving the sense that this place was once inhabited by a technologically advanced civilization. In the distance, gigantic, menacing silhouettes of monstrous creatures can be vaguely seen, partially obscured by the darkness and the luminous mist that hangs heavy in the air.\n\nSuspended above, massive interconnected structures and platforms dangle precariously, connected by rusted chains and cables that creak ominously. These platforms house advanced but decaying technologyâ€”glowing holographic interfaces flicker with ancient data, and robotic sentries lie dormant, cloaked in the shadow.\n\nThe art uses bold lines and minimal detail to capture the stark contrast between light and dark, amplifying the sense of fear and danger. The overall visual style is flat-shaded 3D digital art, with simple but striking color schemes and sharp, well-defined edges that contribute to the unsettling atmosphere. \n\nTags: gelbooru, sci-fi, underworld, concept art, low light, dark shadows, minimal detail, 3D digital art, flat shaded, bold lines, eerie, bioluminescence, advanced technology, ruins, monstrous silhouettes, holographic interfaces, futuristic decay, sense of danger.",
