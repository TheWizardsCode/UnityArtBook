  "Prompt": "A futuristic, dystopian capital underworld, deep beneath a sprawling cyberpunk metropolis. The architecture comprises crumbling infrastructure, with colossal metallic pipes and beams entwined like serpents. Massive industrial machinery looms ominously, partially hidden in shadow. The scant lighting is from flickering neon signs and dim, ominous blue bioluminescent organisms. A network of narrow, winding alleyways is lined with decrepit, graffiti-covered buildings.\n\nLone humanoid figures with cybernetic enhancements—such as glowing red eyes and robotic limbs—skulk in the shadows, exuding an air of danger. Mechanical drones with surveillance cameras hover near clusters of trash, casting eerie cones of light. In the background, a cavernous abyss drops into darkness, with the occasional burst of steam or sparks flickering from unseen depths below.\n\nTextures are flat and shaded, using bold, sharp lines to accentuate the decay and grit. The color palette is muted and cold, dominated by dark blues, grays, and flickers of harsh neon hues. The high-quality image conveys a palpable sense of dread and dystopian despair, ensuring the viewer feels the oppressive atmosphere of \"The Underworld\".\n\nTags: sci-fi, cyberpunk, underworld, dark, shadows, neon, cybernetic, dystopia, 3d, digital_art, minimal_detail, bold_lines, dangerous, eerie.",
