  "Prompt": "An underground realm filled with towering, jagged metallic structures, illuminated by eerie, bioluminescent fungi glowing with a greenish hue. The cavernous space is punctuated by high-tech machinery, rusted and decayed, hinting at a once advanced but now forgotten civilization. A labyrinth of twisted metal pathways suspended above a seemingly bottomless abyss conveys a sense of danger and trepidation. The atmosphere is thick with fog and distant, indistinct sounds echo through the darkness. Lighting levels are low, casting deep, foreboding shadows that obscure potential threats. The art style is flat-shaded 3D digital art, with bold, black outlines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark, unsettling environment. Tags to use: 3d, digital_art, flat_shaded, eerie, underworld, sci-fi, metallic_structures, bioluminescent_fungi, rusted_machinery, labyrinthine_paths, dark_shadows, minimal_detail.",
