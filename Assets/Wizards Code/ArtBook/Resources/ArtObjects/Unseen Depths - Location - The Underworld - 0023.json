  "Prompt": "A sci-fi underworld teeming with unsettling elements. The sprawling cavern city bathed in minimal lighting accentuates the darkness, with various bioluminescent fungi casting an eerie glow. Skeletal structures of obliterated futuristic machinery litter the foreground, some partially submerged in stagnant pools of thick, viscous liquid. Alien flora with tendrils that seem to move create the feeling of an almost sentient landscape. The towering, jagged rock formations and darkened tunnels are illuminated only by the sporadic flickering of malfunctioning neon lights. Shadows lurk in corners, and strange, indistinct shapes hint at hidden dangers. Misty fog rolls through the scene, diffusing the light and wrapping the setting in an otherworldly haze. The sky above the cavern is obscured by a lattice of cybernetic cables and broken holographic billboards, giving it a dystopian touch. The stylistic approach features flat shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal details, enhancing the overall feeling of mystery and dread. #sci-fi #underworld #cave #alien #dystopian #bioluminescent #dark_shadows #minimal_lighting #futuristic_machinery #neon_lights #eerie_glow #cybernetic #dystopian_environment #alien_flora #viscous_liquid #misty_fog #bold_lines #minimal_detail",
