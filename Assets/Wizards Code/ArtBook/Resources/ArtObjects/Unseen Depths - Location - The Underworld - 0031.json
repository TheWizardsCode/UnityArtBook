  "Prompt": "In the deep recesses beneath a technologically advanced city, the underworld reveals itself as a sprawling, dystopian maze. Metallic walls, adorned with flickering neon lights and holographic graffiti, confine the narrow passages. Hidden in the murky shadows, cables and rusty pipes snake across the cracked ground. At the center, a colossal, ancient machine hums ominously, shrouded in darkness. Muted emergency lights illuminate parts of the scene with a cold, eerie blue glow, casting elongated, unsettling shadows. The air seems heavy, filled with an otherworldly mist that distorts vision. Oddly shaped structures, reminiscent of alien architecture, jut out from the ground, their surfaces covered in strange, unreadable symbols. Sporadic bursts of steam hiss from vents, adding to the sense of unpredictability and danger. The only companions in this forsaken place are distant, echoing footsteps and the constant hum of unseen machinery. In the distance, glowing red sensors hint at the presence of some lurking, unseen guardians. The image is rendered in a simple flat shaded 3D digital art style, with bold lines and minimal detail, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and sense of fear.",
