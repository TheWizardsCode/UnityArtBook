  "Prompt": "A sprawling, eerie cityscape in the underworld, where futuristic structures tower ominously with jagged, angular designs. The architecture is a blend of dark metals and neon lights, casting an unsettling glow on the surroundings. In the background, there's a dark, swirling vortex, hinting at portals to other sinister realms. The ground is a conglomerate of shattered glass and metal debris, reflecting fragmented lights. Shadows dominate the scene, with occasional flickering lights providing minimal illumination. Ghostly, robotic figures patrol the area, their red eyes piercing through the darkness. Alien flora with bioluminescent properties sporadically grow amongst the rubble, their light casting strange, shifting shadows. The air is thick with fog, making the scene even more menacing. Overhead, cables and pipes snake through the sky like dark tendrils, adding to the oppressive atmosphere. \n\nTags: underworld, sci-fi, dark cityscape, futuristic architecture, low lighting, dark shadows, neon lights, eerie, fear, danger, simple_3D_render, flat_shaded, bold lines, minimal detail, robotic figures, bioluminescent, alien flora, foggy atmosphere, unsettling.",
