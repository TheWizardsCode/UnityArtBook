  "Prompt": "An expansive, eerie underground labyrinth, with twisting, metallic corridors illuminated by dim, flickering lights creating ominous shadows. The air is dense with fog and scattered debris, suggesting a decaying, abandoned facility. The pathways are lined with tall, foreboding structures made of dark, matte alloy, covered with glowing, cryptic symbols. Rusted, malfunctioning machinery and cables snake across the floors and walls, adding to the post-apocalyptic vibe. In the background, a massive, foreboding chasm cuts through the underground, hinting at deeper, unexplored horrors. The simplicity of the flat shaded 3D digital art brings a stark, chilling atmosphere to the scene. The bold lines and lack of intricate detail create a sense of unsettling barrenness and impending danger. \n\nGtags: dim_lighting, metallic_corridors, flickering_lights, dark_shadows, foggy_atmosphere, decaying_facility, cryptic_symbols, malfunctioning_machinery, post_apocalyptic, underground_chasm, flat_shaded, 3D_digital_art, bold_lines, low_detail, eerie_labyrinth",
