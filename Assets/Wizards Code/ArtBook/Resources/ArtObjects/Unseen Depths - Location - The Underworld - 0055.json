  "Prompt": "A vast, cavernous underworld teeming with jagged alien rock formations and towering metallic structures. A dark, foreboding atmosphere dominates the scene, with shafts of dim, bluish light seeping through cracks in the ceiling, casting eerie, elongated shadows across the barren ground. Sleek, futuristic machinery with glowing, pulsating lights stand amongst the rocks, half-buried and abandoned. Pools of iridescent liquid, glowing faintly in shades of green and purple, form around the bases of the machinery, emitting a soft hum. The walls are rugged, and fragmented, giving a sense of an ancient world, long neglected and unwelcoming. Sinister mechanical creatures with segmented limbs can be seen lurking in the shadows, their eyes emitting a faint red glow. The flat-shaded 3D digital art style uses bold, clear lines to define shapes, with a focus on creating a stark, frightening environment that invokes dread.
