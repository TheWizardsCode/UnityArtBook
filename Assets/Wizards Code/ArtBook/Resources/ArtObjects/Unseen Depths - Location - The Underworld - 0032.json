  "Prompt": "A vast underground cavern stretches out, bathed in eerie, dim light that casts long and foreboding shadows. The cavern walls are jagged and covered with futuristic, metallic panels and tubing, illuminated sporadically by glowing, neon-blue and green circuitry. Alien machinery and technology, partially buried in the walls, hint at an abandoned, dystopian society. Large, ominous vents and pipes run along the ceiling and ground, occasionally releasing clouds of steam that add to the atmosphere of danger. The floor is uneven, consisting of both rough, rocky terrain and sleek, but cracked, synthetic platforms.\n\nStalactites hang menacingly from the ceiling, dripping with black, oily liquid that forms reflective, toxic-looking pools on the cavern floor. Strange, bioluminescent fungi grow sporadically, casting a slight, ghostly glow. A narrow, treacherous path winds through the cavern, leading to a massive, intricate doorway embedded into the far wallâ€”its surface covered with alien glyphs and symbols that flicker with an otherworldly light. The entire scene is rendered in flat-shaded, 3D digital art, with bold, thick outlines and minimal detail, emphasizing the vast emptiness and minimalist yet terrifying concept of the underworld. The overall emotion is one of fear and unease, as if the environment itself is a living entity waiting to ensnare any intruders.",
