  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding underworld is presented, characterized by a cavernous, sprawling subterranean environment with eerie, low lighting casting deep shadows and creating a sense of fear and danger. The architecture consists of massive, monolithic structures with intricate, angular designs; these structures give the impression of an ancient, high-tech society long abandoned. Stalactites and stalagmites are mixed with futuristic machinery, some of which are massive, rusted gears and pipes intertwining and disappearing into the shadows. There are deep, seemingly bottomless pits with ominous glows emanating from within.\n\nThe scene includes strange, alien flora that emit ghostly, bioluminescent lights, providing minimal illumination and adding to the eerie atmosphere. The ground is littered with the remains of unmanned drones and robotic entities, mostly dark silhouettes against dimly lit backgrounds. Sporadic pools of toxic-looking liquid reflect the minimal available light, adding an additional layer of danger. The overall color palette leans towards dark blues, grays, and blacks, with only the occasional neon highlights.\n\nThis simplistic, flat-shaded 3D digital art style uses bold lines and minimal detail to emphasize the stark environment. The setting feels both oppressive and expansive, with large open spaces that fade into dark obscurity. The sense of scale is reinforced by small, scattered remnants and debris hinting at the former presence of life whilst maintaining an overwhelming emptiness.\n\nTags: simple_background, flat_shading, 3D_render, sci-fi, dark_fantasy, alien_environment, monolithic_structures, bioluminescence, futuristic, ancient_technology, eerie_glow, robotic_remains, toxic_pools, angular_design, minimalistic_art, bold_lines.",
