  "Prompt": "Sci-fi setting, underground labyrinth. Vast cavernous landscape filled with jagged rock formations and sinister-looking machinery embedded into the walls. Luminescent, neon-blue veins of energy roil through the rocky terrain, casting eerie glow. Dark shadows stretch and blend, hinting at unseen threats in the depths. Multiple pathways crisscross the scenery, some leading to ominous, yawning chasms while others climb towards distant, unseen exits. The labyrinth is home to mechanical constructs; spider-like robots patrol narrow corridors, their red sensor lights piercing through the dark. Hanging from the ceiling, huge stalactites shaped like rusted, metallic spikes create a sense of danger. The lighting is dim and moody, emphasizing the contrast between light and dark, casting long shadows that obscure much of the setting. The bold lines and minimal detail of the flat shaded 3D digital art lend an unsettling simplicity, enhancing the sense of foreboding.
