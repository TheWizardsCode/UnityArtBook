  "Prompt": "A vast, cavernous underworld scene characterized by towering, jagged rock formations with bioluminescent moss that casts an eerie blue-green glow. The ground is uneven, littered with broken machinery and alien artifacts, hinting at a past civilization. Streams of glowing, molten liquid flow through crevices, casting ominous red reflections on the cavern walls. Suspended in the air are translucent, pulsating cocoons emitting a faint, unsettling hum. Large, shadowy figures lurk in the background, their silhouettes barely visible, adding to the sense of impending threat. The lighting is low and moody, with deep pockets of darkness that conceal hidden dangers. The art style is flat-shaded with bold, distinct lines, and minimal details, focusing on conveying a sense of fear and danger through the composition and lighting.",
