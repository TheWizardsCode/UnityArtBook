  "Prompt": "A dark, ominous sci-fi underworld, with towering, twisted metallic structures emerging from the ground, reminiscent of a labyrinth. The scene is lit by a few scattered, flickering neon lights in blue and red hues, casting eerie shadows across the environment. The ground is uneven, covered with cracked, dark surfaces and scattered debris. In the background, faint silhouettes of alien machinery and bizarre technology can be seen, partially obscured by mist. The area exudes an aura of desolation and danger, with toxic green pools emitting a faint, ominous glow. The sky above appears as a grimy industrial ceiling, with exposed pipes and hanging wires. The air is thick with unseen smog, adding to the claustrophobic atmosphere. The overall aesthetic is simple, flat shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail, creating a sense of depth and mystery with its low lighting levels and dramatic shadows.
