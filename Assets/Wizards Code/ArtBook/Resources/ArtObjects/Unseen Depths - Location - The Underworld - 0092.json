  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding underworld scene filled with advanced, dystopian technology. The landscape is an eerie labyrinth of colossal metal structures, partially submerged in a toxic, reflective sludge that emits a faint radioactive glow. The lighting is dim, casting long, ominous shadows that conceal threats lurking in the darkness. The air is thick with fog, sparsely illuminated by malfunctioning neon lights, which flicker sporadically to reveal rusted cables and broken machinery. The architecture is brutalist with sharp, angular edges and monolithic forms, towering over the scene. \n\nIn the background, a massive energy reactor hums ominously, surrounded by floating drones that patrol the area with menacing red eyes. The sky, barely visible through the dense smog, flickers with bursts of electrical storms, casting brief moments of harsh light across the scene. \n\nThe character designs blend human and machine, with cybernetic appendages and glowing, digitized eyes, exuding an air of cold efficiency and danger. The color palette is dominated by dark, muted tones with occasional splashes of acidic green and electric blue to emphasize the toxic, unwelcoming environment. \n\nUse of tags: dark, dystopian, sci-fi, toxic, cyberpunk, fog, neon_lights, brutalist_architecture, cybernetic_parts, drones, radioactive_glow, minimalist_art, flat_shaded, thick_lines, eerie, ominous.",
