  "Prompt": "A sprawling underground metropolis stretches out beneath a cracked, earthen ceiling, where stalactite-like structures emit a faint, eerie blue glow. The streets are filled with sleek, eerie, biomechanical buildings made of a disturbing blend of metal and organic material. Some structures appear almost grotesque with tissue-like textures blended into hard edges. Flickering neon signs in an alien script cast a pallid, otherworldly light, adding to the sense of unease. \n\nIn the distance, a massive energy core hums ominously, housed in a fortress-like facility made of dark, reflective black metal and surrounded by twisted, sinewy cables. The area closer to the viewer is filled with deserted market stalls, dilapidated hover vehicles, and piles of discarded tech and strange, biological remnants. Dark, cavernous alleys snake into the distance, shadows consuming their depths, whispering an invitation laced with danger.\n\nRobotic guardians with crimson, glowing eyes patrol the area, their menacing forms emphasizing the perilous atmosphere. A labyrinthine network of pipes and conduits runs along the ceilings and walls, dripping unknown, luminescent fluids that form puddles, reflecting ambient light with a sickly hue. Overhead, the sky is a dark void, hinting at the immense weight of the world above.\n\n(Tags: dark, shadows, high-tech, cityscape, biomechanical, neon, eerie, glowing, cavern, sci-fi, robotic, menacing, minimalist, fear, danger, low light, bold lines, minimal detail)",
