  "Prompt": "An underground dystopian sci-fi landscape, predominantly shrouded in low lighting, casting menacing dark shadows and creating numerous unseen areas. The environment features vast, cavernous spaces with rocky, craggy walls, intermittently lit by glowing, pulsing machinery and neon signs in stark, bright red, orange, and yellow. The machinery looks industrial and alien, with a series of large, segmented pipes, intricate network of exposed wires, and vents exuding an eerie, dim light. Scatterings of futuristic equipment, like control panels with holographic displays, hover drones, and varying sizes of metallic crates, add complexity to the scene.\n\nThe ground is uneven and littered with ambiguous debris, some of which is illuminated by the light emanating from the technology, while other parts remain obscured in shadow, enhancing the sense of fear and danger. Humanoid figures with cybernetic enhancements wander about, their silhouettes barely visible in the dim environment, distinguished by glowing limbs or eyes. They carry futuristic tools and weapons, appearing on high alert. \n\nThe sky, if present, is obscured by an intricate web of pipes and cables that stretch overhead, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere. Occasional sparks of electricity and the soft hum of machinery fill the air, as the shadows dance ominously across the scene, maintaining an unnerving ambiance.\n\nThe image quality is exceptionally high, with crisp lines and a seamless blend of colors, ensuring each element, despite the minimalistic, flat-shaded style, stands out vividly against the murky background. Rich in bold, contrasting colors and dynamic lighting effects, the image captures the essence of a perilous futuristic underworld. The tags to use for this scene: dark_shadows, neon_lighting, glowing_machinery, industrial_sci-fi, cavernous, segmented_pipes, cybernetic_enhancements, futuristic_tools, claustrophobic_atmosphere, flat_shaded, bold_lines, high_quality, 3D_digital_art.",
