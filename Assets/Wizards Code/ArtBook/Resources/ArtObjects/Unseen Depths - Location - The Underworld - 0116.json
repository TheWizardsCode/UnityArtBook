  "Prompt": "A dystopian sci-fi underworld, illuminated by flickering neon lights casting eerie, distorted glows around the scene. The sky is a perpetual, electric shade of dark purple, with flashes of lightning occasionally highlighting the industrial silhouettes. The environment is an expansive subterranean city, with towering, rusting metal buildings adorned with cables and exposed pipes, stretching ever upward. Dark alleyways twist and turn, lined with graffiti-covered walls, holographic advertisements, and malfunctioning robotics. Pools of toxic green liquid collect in the crevices of cracked concrete streets, and the low-level haze creates a suffocating atmosphere.\n\nSilhouettes of humanoid figures with cybernetic enhancements lurk in the shadows, their eyes glowing with a menacing red tint. A central, massive structure serves as the dark heart of this underworld, its architecture sleek and imposing, with sharp angles and emitting a low hum of mechanical energy. Few flying drones patrol the air, their searchlights piercing through the darkness. Sporadic bursts of electrical sparks and the constant, rhythmic clanking of machinery provide an unsettling soundtrack to this bleak, perilous environment.\n\nThe environment is brought to life with flat-shaded 3D digital art, using bold lines and geometric forms, lacking intricate details but conveying a strong, oppressive atmosphere. The lighting is deliberately low, creating deep shadows and vast sections of obscured, unseen territories, invoking a pervasive sense of foreboding and danger.\n\nTags: \"sci-fi, dystopian, underworld, neon lights, dark shadows, industrial, cyberpunk, rusty metal, toxic, cybernetic enhancements, flickering lights, holographic advertisements, minimal detail, bold lines, flat shaded, 3D digital art, fear, danger, atmospheric, eerie\"",
