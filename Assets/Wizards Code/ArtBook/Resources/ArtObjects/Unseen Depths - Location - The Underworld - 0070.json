  "Prompt": "A dark and eerie sci-fi underworld environment; the scene features low lighting and ominous shadows that create a sense of fear and danger. The subterranean landscape is a mix of alien and mechanical elements, with towering, jagged rock formations and massive industrial machinery integrated into the environment. There are glowing neon pathways and pulsating lights leading deeper into the unknown, partially illuminating the sinister atmosphere. Unknown cybernetic creatures with sleek, menacing designs lurk in the shadows, with piercing red eyes glowing in the darkness. The ground is a mixture of metallic and rocky textures, with strange, bioluminescent plants scattered around. The sky above is an inky black void with occasional flashes of mysterious light. The art style is simple flat shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark contrast between light and shadow.
