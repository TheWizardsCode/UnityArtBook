  "Prompt": "A futuristic, dystopian sci-fi underworld with a dark, eerie atmosphere. The environment is an underground complex with sprawling, maze-like corridors and cavernous chambers. The image is characterized by dim, ominous lighting with deep shadows obscuring large sections of the scene, creating a sense of dread and uncertainty. The walls are lined with metallic panels, pipes, and conduits, all rendered in a simple flat shaded 3D style, featuring bold lines and minimal details. Various machinery and equipment are present, all painted in striking, high-contrast colors such as bright red, orange, and yellow. These colors stand out vividly against the gloomy background, adding a sense of heightened danger. Advanced control panels and holographic interfaces flicker erratically, casting a ghostly light that further amplifies the tension. The corridors are littered with discarded robotic parts and debris, suggesting a recent conflict or catastrophic event. Shadows of unknown creatures or menacing figures are barely visible in the darkness, contributing to the overall sense of fear. Smoke or mist drifts through the air, catching the limited light and adding to the mysterious, threatening ambiance.
