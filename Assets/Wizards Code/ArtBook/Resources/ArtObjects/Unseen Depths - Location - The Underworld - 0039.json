  "Prompt": "A dystopian underworld location featuring a sprawling subterranean city built into the walls of a massive cavern. The architecture is a chaotic mix of futuristic and decaying structures, with towering skyscrapers made of metal and glass, interspersed with crumbling buildings and exposed pipes. Numerous walkways and bridges crisscross the cavern, connecting different levels and sections of the city. Dim, flickering neon lights and holographic signs cast eerie glows on the grimy, grimy surfaces. Dark shadows and unseen areas form menacing pockets of danger, with hidden mechanical creatures and lurking threats. The cavernâ€™s ceiling is barely visible, shrouded in darkness, and dripping with stalactites covered in bioluminescent moss. The overall color palette is a mix of desaturated blues, greens, and metallic grays, with occasional bursts of neon colors. The image is rendered in flat-shaded 3D digital art, characterized by bold lines and minimal detail, enhancing the sense of fear and danger. \n\nTags: underground_city, dystopian, sci-fi, dark_shadows, neon_lights, digital_3D_art, bold_lines, minimal_detail, flickering_lights, mechanical_creatures, holographic_signs, low_lighting, eerie_glow, unseen_threats, complex_architecture, cavernous_environment, bioluminescent_moss, dripping_stalactites.",
