  "Prompt": "A vast, labyrinthine cavern stretches out in all directions, the rocky walls jagged and uneven, illuminated only by the faint, eerie glow of bioluminescent fungi scattered sporadically across the area. Stalactites and stalagmites form massive, menacing structures that loom over pools of dark, undisturbed water reflecting the minimal light. The cavernâ€™s floor is uneven, with sharp drops and unexpected inclines. \n\nIn the background, towering, futuristic machinery is partially embedded in the cavern walls, old and rusted, with pulsating lights suggesting they are still somewhat operational despite their age. Small hovering drones with narrow beams of light glide through the space, casting fleeting illuminations and shadows, heightening a sense of movement and unease. Flickers of electricity surge through exposed cables that run along the ground and ceiling. \n\nThe air is thick with mist and the smell of ozone. The entire scene uses flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the foreboding atmosphere and leaving much to the imagination.
