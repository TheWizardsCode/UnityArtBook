  "Prompt": "A vast, eerie underworld landscape stretches out, illuminated faintly by bioluminescent fungi scattered across the ground and cavern walls. The ground is covered with rough, cracked surfaces with glowing cracks. Stalactites and stalagmites are sharp and exaggerated, making the environment feel more menacing. In the distance, massive, abstract structures jut out of the darkness, giving a sense of ancient, forgotten technology. Pools of dark, viscous liquid reflect eerie light, hinting at unknown depths and lurking dangers. Alien flora with phosphorescent spores add to the mysterious ambiance. Shadows dominate the scene, with minimal light revealing only glimpses of pathways and hidden corners. The minimalist 3D digital art style emphasizes bold lines and flat shading, creating a stark, graphic novel-like appearance. High quality image, with deep blacks and vibrant glowing elements, ensuring each element stands out despite the overall darkness.
