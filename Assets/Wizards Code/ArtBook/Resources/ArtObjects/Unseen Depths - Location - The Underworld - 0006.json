  "Prompt": "The scene captures a futuristic underworld environment, bathed in low lighting that casts deep, foreboding shadows and conceals ominous corners. Dominant colors are dark, but machinery and textiles stand out in strikingly bright hues of red, orange, and yellow, enhancing the scene's intense atmosphere. Flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold outlines and minimal detailing creates a stark visual impact. Gears, mechanical contraptions, and intricate pipes intertwine throughout the space, evoking a sense of complexity and unease. There are neon lights flickering sporadically, casting eerie glows across the space. Robotic drones patrol around, their metallic surfaces gleaming menacingly under the sparse illumination. The architecture features sharp, angular designs that further add to the sense of danger and foreboding. This underworld is both a labyrinth and a high-tech nightmare, teeming with unseen threats lurking in its shadows. The overall ambience is one of trepidation and high tension, tailored to evoke fear and curiosity in the viewer.",
