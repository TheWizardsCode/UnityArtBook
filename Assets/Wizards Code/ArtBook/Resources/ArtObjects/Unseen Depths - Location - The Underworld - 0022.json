  "Prompt": "A sci-fi scene depicting \"The Underworld\" with a foreboding, eerie atmosphere. The setting is an expansive, dimly lit cavern with jagged, metallic structures emerging from the ground and walls. In the center, a massive, ancient machine covered in cables and conduits gives off a faint, ominous red glow. Shadows are deep and stark, with illumination only provided by scattered, flickering neon lights. The cavern floor is uneven and made of dark, almost black metallic rock, with patches of glowing, bioluminescent moss. Strange, robotic creatures with glowing eyes and sharp appendages lurk in the darkness, barely visible except for their silhouettes and occasional eye gleams. The air is thick with a subtle mist, and the background is obscured by layers of shadow and metallic forms. The overall aesthetic is flat shaded 3D digital art, featuring bold lines and minimal detail to emphasize the sense of fear and the unknown.
