  "Prompt": "A vast, dark, foreboding underground cityscape with towering, monolithic structures of smooth, matte black metal, designed in angular, asymmetrical shapes. The ground is covered by a layer of luminous, blue bio-luminescent moss that partially illuminates the scene with an eerie glow. Large, rusted mechanical constructs, resembling twisted amalgamations of machines and skeletal remains, scatter throughout this landscape. Jagged, hazardous terrain and deep chasms add a sense of peril, while strange, alien machinery intermittently emits flickering, neon red light, casting elongated shadows across the environment. Ethereal, ghost-like entities with an unsettling presence linger in the shadows, partially obscured from view. Sporadic, broken-up holographic displays flicker with indecipherable symbols, adding to the tension and unearthly atmosphere. The overall flat-shaded, minimalist 3D art style with bold lines reduces the world's complexity, instilling a surreal and deeply unsettling aura. The high-quality image exhibits exceptional rendering fidelity, ensuring realistic lighting and shadow effects in a distinct, sharp visual style.",
