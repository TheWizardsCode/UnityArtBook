  "Prompt": "a vast, cavernous underground sci-fi landscape with jagged rock formations and metallic structures integrated seamlessly into the environment, illuminated sparsely by eerie, glowing green and blue bioluminescent fungi and advanced, flickering hover-lights suspended from the ceiling. The ground is rough, with patches of unusual, glowing alien vegetation intermittently breaking its monotonous texture. Scattered throughout the scene are dark, foreboding tunnels leading into blackness, suggesting unexplored and dangerous areas. Strange, ghostly forms or shadows move just out of clear sight, adding to the ominous atmosphere. Large, menacing robotic sentinels patrol the area, their red optic sensors cutting through the dark. The horizon is dominated by a massive, dilapidated alien structure, partially buried in the rock and exuding a mysterious energy. The image uses a simple, flat shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail, enhancing the sense of fear and danger.
