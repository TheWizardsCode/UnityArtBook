  "Prompt": "A dark and foreboding sci-fi underworld scene with intricate and twisted metallic structures. The environment is a labyrinth of alien-like tunnels and caverns, with bioluminescent fungi casting an eerie glow. The lighting is dim, creating deep shadows that conceal lurking dangers. Mutant creatures with glowing eyes and sharp claws hide in the shadows, giving a sense of fear and imminent danger. The walls are covered in strange, glowing runes and pulsating, organic machinery. There are abandoned, rusted spacecraft and futuristic ruins, partially consumed by the organic growth. The atmosphere is thick with a toxic fog, and occasional sparks of electricity light up the dark corners momentarily. The color palette includes dark purples, blues, and sickly greens to enhance the ominous feeling. This flat shaded 3D digital art style has bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing shapes and forms over textures. Predominant Gelbooru tags might include: dark_background, low_light, bioluminescence, alien_terrain, glowing_eyes, organic_machinery, abandoned_technology, toxic_fog, mutant_creatures.",
