  "Prompt": "A dark and eerie sci-fi scene set in the underworld of a distant planet. The environment is dominated by vast, dark caverns with sharp, angular rock formations and deep shadows. The lighting is minimal, casting long, menacing shadows and leaving large areas veiled in darkness. Amidst this, there are strikingly bright and jarring elements of machinery and textiles in vivid reds, oranges, and yellows. \n\nRobotic creatures with sleek but intimidating designs patrol the area, with their eyes glowing a sinister shade of red. The machinery is in a state of disrepair, covered in rust and grime, yet still operational, creating an oppressive atmosphere. Tubing and cables snake through the scene, illuminated by the sporadic flicker of malfunctioning lights. \n\nThere are several structures that hint at an abandoned underground civilization, their walls adorned with stark, angular patterns that glow faintly. Odd, mechanical plants with metallic leaves also protrude from the ground, their surfaces catching the dim light and reflecting it in an eerie glow. \n\nDark, ominous shadows loom in the background, suggesting hidden threats, and the glow from alien technology casts an unsettling light across the rocky terrain. There are no classical fantasy elements; rather, the scene is purely sci-fi, utilizing flat-shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail, heightening the sense of fear and danger in this dystopian underworld. \n\n(tags: 3d, digital art, sci-fi, underworld, dark, machinery, red, orange, yellow, shadows, minimal detail, glowing eyes, eerie, mechanical plants, abandoned civilization, rust, cables, alien technology, bold lines)",
