  "Prompt": "A sprawling subterranean city sprawls out, defined by dark, jagged architecture with twisted, alien-like structures. Fluorescent, sickly green and ominous red lights illuminate portions of the area, casting eerie glows and long shadows. The organic, hive-like buildings are formed from a dark, metallic material, with sharp, uneven angles and extruding pipes that appear almost as veins. \n\nThe ground is uneven, with cracks and molten lava sporadically oozing through. Robotic sentinels with an insectoid design patrol the dark, fog-clad streets, their red eyes piercing the gloom. A dense fog billows around, obscuring details and enhancing the sense of dread. Strange, luminescent fungi and bioluminescent plants provide scant illumination, giving off an unnatural glow.\n\nResidents appear as shadowy silhouettes, with sleek, cybernetic enhancements and glowing eyes that reflect mistrust and aggression. The air is thick with a toxic miasma, indicated by floating particles and the atmospheric haze. In the background, a massive structure looms, possibly a central hub or a dark monarchy's palace, with multiple spires piercing the cavernous ceiling. \n\nLighting is minimal, with harsh shadows and faint light sources that barely penetrate the darkness. The scene is conveyed in a simple, flat-shaded, 3D digital art style, with bold, hard lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the sense of danger and unseen threats lurking just out of sight.
