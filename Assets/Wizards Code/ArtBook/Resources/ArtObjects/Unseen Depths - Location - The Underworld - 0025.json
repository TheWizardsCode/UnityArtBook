  "Prompt": "A dark, cavernous underworld with towering, jagged rock formations and narrow pathways covered in a mysterious bioluminescent moss. Dim, eerie lighting from unseen sources casts long shadows and obscures most of the environment, creating a sense of fear and danger. The ground is uneven, littered with alien artifacts and broken machinery, indicative of past, failed expeditions. Massive, rusted metal doors partially embedded into the rock walls hint at long-abandoned, hidden facilities. Throughout the scene, flickering lights and occasional sparks from damaged electrical panels add to the ominous atmosphere. The image is rendered using simple flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, enhancing the unsettling, abstract nature of the underworld. Tags: sci-fi, underworld, cavern, low lighting, shadows, bioluminescent, broken machinery, abandoned facility, eerie, flat shaded, 3d digital art, bold lines.",
