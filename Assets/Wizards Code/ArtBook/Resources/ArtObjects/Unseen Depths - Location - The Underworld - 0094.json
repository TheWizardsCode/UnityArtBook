  "Prompt": "A desolate cityscape stretches beneath a colossal, brooding sky where lightning crackles within swirling storm clouds. The underworld lays sprawled out with tall, dilapidated structures made of dark, corroded metal that twist and lean unnaturally. Neon lights flicker intermittently in eerie hues of neon purple and sickly green, casting disturbing shadows and highlighting the decay. The ground is littered with debris, rusted machinery, and broken streetlights. Deep chasms split the landscape revealing underground tunnels glowing ominously with an unearthly light. Hovering drones patrol the skies, emitting low hums as their bright searchlights cut through the smog. Silhouettes of lurking figures and grotesque creatures can be glimpsed in the shadows. High-end digital art quality with clean, bold lines and flat shading, minimal texturing. Tags: sci-fi, dark, dystopian, cyberpunk, eerie, low-light, neon, shadows, futuristic, decay, 3D digital art, bold lines, minimal detail.",
