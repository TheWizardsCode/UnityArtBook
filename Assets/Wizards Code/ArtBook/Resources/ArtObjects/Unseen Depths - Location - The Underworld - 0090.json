  "Prompt": "A sprawling, eerie subterranean metropolis bathed in a faint, otherworldly greenish-blue glow. Massive, crumbling cybernetic structures form haphazard streets and pathways, with cables and pipes intricately weaving through the environment. In the distance, towering, jagged skyscrapers constructed from a mix of dark metals and bioluminescent materials loom ominously. The city is shrouded in thick, swirling fog, with shadowy details of broken-down hovercrafts, dilapidated androids, and neon signs flickering erratically. The ground is uneven, with cracked, metallic surfaces and pools of mysterious, glowing liquids. Here and there, glimpses of robotic guardians patrolling, their red, laser-like eyes piercing through the darkness. Everything is depicted in flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold, angular lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark and desolate atmosphere. The low lighting and the depths of the unseen areas invoke a sense of fear and danger, making it feel as though danger lurks around every corner.
