The location is an enormous underground industrial complex with labyrinthine corridors and towering, rusted machinery. The scene is filled with a dense, foreboding atmosphere, reminiscent of a long-abandoned facility where something went terribly wrong. \n\nDim, flickering neon lights cast eerie glows along the walls, reflecting off pools of stagnant liquid scattered across the metallic floor. Audible drips and distant mechanical hums pervade the space, amplifying the sense of unease. Several deep, yawning pits drop off into nothingness, filled with impenetrable blackness, while vents emit wisps of steam that coil and vanish into the shadows.\n\nMysterious, intricate glyphs and warning symbols are etched into the surfaces, partially illuminated by the sparse light sources. Occasionally, faint silhouettes suggest lurking dangers, with ominous red eyes peering from the darkness. The air feels charged with an unsettling energy, and the oppressive silence is intermittently broken by distant, echoing sounds.\n\nThe visual style employs flat shading in a 3D digital format with bold, distinct lines. The overall aesthetic is minimalistic yet striking, using sharp contrasts between light and dark to emphasize the hidden threats and create a gripping tension. This high-quality image excels in conveying a deeply unsettling sense of fear and danger, perfectly fitting the theme of \"The Underworld.\"",
