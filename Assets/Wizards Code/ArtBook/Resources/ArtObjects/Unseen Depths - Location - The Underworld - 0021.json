  "Prompt": "A sprawling underground city with towering, futuristic skyscrapers emerges from the rocky terrain, bathed in an eerie, dim glow provided by bioluminescent fungi clinging to the cavern walls. The buildings are constructed from dark, metallic materials, with jagged, angular designs that give a menacing feel. The skyline is interrupted by occasional steam vents that emit a toxic green haze, adding to the ominous atmosphere. Narrow, labyrinthine streets weave between the structures, lined with flickering neon signs that hang from rusted metal poles. Shadows dance and shift as occasional light sources cast long, foreboding shapes across the environment. \n\nFigures in the scene are seen wearing sleek, high-tech body armor with visors that emit a faint, cold light, suggesting surveillance and control. Drones hover silently above the streets, their red sensors peeking through the darkness, tracking every move. The ground is littered with debris from past conflicts, including damaged robotic appendages and shattered glass.\n\nIn the distance, a colossal gate carved into the cavern wall looms, framed by intricate patterns glowing with a faint, otherworldly light. Patches of exposed underground rivers of molten metal cut through the city, adding a glow to the surrounding darkness. \n\nDistinct elements: sci-fi, underworld, dark shadows, eerie lighting, bioluminescent fungi, toxic steam vents, neon signs, high-tech body armor, surveillance drones, debris, colossal gate, molten metal rivers; flat shaded 3D digital art, bold lines, minimal detail tags.",
