  "Prompt": "A vast, sprawling, cavernous environment illuminated by eerie bioluminescent flora, casting a ghostly glow. The ground is rugged and broken, filled with jagged rocks and deep, ominous crevices. A giant, abandoned futuristic mining machine looms in the background, half-buried under layers of dark, damp earth. Scattered around are remnants of advanced technology, half-dismantled robots and decaying metallic structures. \n\nThe space is shrouded in a thick, almost palpable mist, with shadows lurking in every corner, hinting at unseen dangers. The air is filled with floating digital holographs that flicker erratically, projecting cryptic, incomplete data in alien languages. \n\nIn the foreground, there is an eerie, luminous river of an unknown liquid cutting through the terrain, its surface rippling with unidentifiable creatures beneath. Jagged stalactites hang dangerously from the ceiling above, dripping with curious glowing icor. \n\nThe lighting is minimal, with the primary sources being the bioluminescent vegetation and occasional sparks from malfunctioning machinery, creating sharp contrasts and deep, foreboding shadows throughout the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of overwhelming claustrophobia and lurking horror.\n\nTags: 1boy, solo, background, 3D digital art, flat colors, bold lines, sci-fi, futuristic, subterranean, cavern, bioluminescence, eerie glow, ruins, advanced technology, foggy, shadows, fear, danger, minimalistic detailing, dark atmosphere, unseen peril.",
