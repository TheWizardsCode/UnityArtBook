  "Prompt": "The Underworld is a dark, sci-fi subterranean cityscape with a foreboding atmosphere. The scene is set in a massive underground cavern, illuminated by eerie, bioluminescent flora and scattered, flickering industrial lights. Enormous, decrepit machinery and ancient, rusting structures with jagged edges loom over a sprawling city below, their silhouettes defined by soft, ominous glows. The city's buildings are made of futuristic metal and neon, arranged chaotically, with wires and pipes crisscrossing the scene, almost like a web. \n\nIn the foreground, there's a shadowy figure clad in a cyberpunk-style tactical suit, standing on a ledge overlooking the city. Drones with red, glowing eyes patrol the skies, adding to the sense of danger. The cavern walls are marred with deep crevices and dark, uncharted tunnels that vanish into the abyss. Vapor and mist rise from metallic grates, and pools of glowing, toxic liquid can be seen scattered around. The air is thick with tension, and every corner hides unseen threats. \n\nThe image style is flat shaded 3D digital art, using bold lines and minimal detail to convey an oppressive and haunting tone. The lighting is low, creating dramatic contrasts between shadowed areas and the sporadic light sources, emphasizing the darkness and the unknown horrors lurking within.",
