  "Prompt": "An expansive sci-fi landscape set in \"The Underworld,\" characterized by a dimly lit, ominous atmosphere where shadows create a looming sense of danger. The environment features a labyrinthine network of industrial machinery and pipes, all glowing with vibrant, contrasting colors of red, orange, and yellow, illuminating the dark surroundings in patches of harsh light. The machinery and infrastructure are intricately designed, with thick, bold lines that define their shape but minimal detail to evoke a stark, flat-shaded appearance. The ground is rough and jagged, interspersed with deep crevasses and rocky formations. High-tech, abandoned structures jut out sporadically, their exteriors glowing faintly, hinting at past civilizations. The overall mood is one of unease, with an unsettling quietness broken occasionally by the distant hum of machinery. Ambient lighting casts long shadows, creating areas of complete darkness that hide potential threats, enhancing the fear and unpredictability of the scene.
