  "Prompt": "The scene is set within a vast, futuristic underworld city hidden beneath a crumbling, post-apocalyptic landscape. Tall, dilapidated skyscrapers made of dark, rusted metal reach up to a domed ceiling lined with large, pulsating cables and flickering neon lights. The streets are narrow and congested with broken-down vehicles, twisted scrap metal, and scattered debris. Dim, cold lights sporadically illuminate the alleyways, casting long, ominous shadows and creating a constant sense of uncertainty and danger. \n\nFigures clad in heavy, makeshift armor and wearing gas masks patrol the streets, their eyes glowing a menacing red. Mechanical drones hover above, scanning the ground with piercing blue lights. Hidden within the shadows, mysterious creatures with cybernetic enhancements lurk, partially visible but mostly shrouded in darkness. The air is thick with fog and the subtle hum of distant machinery echoes through the cavernous space. \n\nGelbooru tags: 2girls, 1boy, heavy armor, cyberpunk city, dim lighting, shadows, sci-fi, drones, gas masks, cybernetic enhancements, dark alleys, broken vehicles, minimal detail, flat shaded 3D, bold lines.\n\nThe image quality is exceptionally high, with crisp, defined edges and an intense, moody atmosphere that is both immersive and unsettling.",
