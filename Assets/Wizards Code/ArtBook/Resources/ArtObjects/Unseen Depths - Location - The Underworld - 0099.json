  "Prompt": "A sci-fi underworld scene set in a vast, industrial cavern. The cavern walls are made of dark, jagged metal and are lined with glowing, pulsating neon veins in shades of deep purple and eerie green (tags: sci-fi, neon, cavern, industrial, dark). Suspended from the cavern ceiling are massive, interconnected pipes and cables, some leaking toxic, luminescent liquid that drips down into the unseen depths below (tags: pipes, cables, toxic, glowing). The ground is a complex network of grated metal walkways, some sections broken or missing, creating treacherous paths with ominous gaps and chasms (tags: grated metal, walkways, chasms). Large, shadowy robotic sentinels patrol the area, their red eyes and fluid movements adding to the atmosphere of constant surveillance and danger (tags: robots, sentinels, red eyes, surveillance). In the background, giant machines hum and buzz, emitting sporadic sparks and flashes of light that briefly illuminate various areas, revealing glimpses of strange, half-hidden alien technology (tags: giant machines, sparks, alien technology). Overall, the low lighting levels with dark shadows and unseen areas create a sense of fear and danger, enhanced by the simple flat shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail (tags: low lighting, shadows, 3D digital art, bold lines).",
