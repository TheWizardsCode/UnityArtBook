  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding sci-fi underworld environment, depicted in simple flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail. The scene is dominated by an expansive, rocky cavern with jagged walls and towering stalactites. Bioluminescent fungi and eerie, glowing crystals sporadically illuminate the cavern, casting ominous shadows. In the distance, an alien city made of irregular, geometrically shaped buildings and interconnected walkways hovers over a dark abyss. The structures emit faint, flickering lights, hinting at the presence of unseen inhabitants. Giant, mechanical tentacles emerging from the ground and walls snake throughout the scene, adding to the sense of danger. Pools of an unknown, toxic-looking liquid gather at the base of the rocks, emitting a faint glow. The atmosphere is thick with fog and floating particles, adding to the sense of fear and danger. There are no visible characters, enhancing the feeling of isolation.
