  "Prompt": "A scene set in the sci-fi underworld: an expansive underground chasm filled with massive, intricate machinery and cavernous tunnels. The walls are constructed from a combination of worn, metallic surfaces and bio-organic materials, giving an eerie feeling as if the place is alive. Gigantic, glowing alien mushrooms and luminescent crystals grow from the ground and walls, casting a ghostly green and purple light. Tall, spindly robotic guards patrol the area, their eye sensors flickering red in the darkness. \n\nIn the distance, towering structures resembling a fusion of factories and alien nests exude steam and strange, misty vapors. There are also pulsating, fleshy masses with embedded cybernetic components growing out of the ground and walls, making faint, unsettling humming noises.\n\nThe ceiling of the cavern is so high it fades into blackness, with occasional robotic drones buzzing in and out of view. Pathways and bridges constructed from metal grates and cables crisscross above yawning abysses, leading to ominous, dark entrances to other parts of the underworld. Random sparks and flickering lights from malfunctioning equipment add to the sense of decay and unpredictability. The lighting is deliberately low, with dark shadows obscuring potential threats, creating an atmosphere of lurking danger and hidden terror.\n\nTags: dark_shadows, sci-fi_machinery, alien_environment, bio-organic_materials, glowing_mushrooms, luminescent_crystals, robotic_guards, alien_nest, cybernetic_components, underground_chasm, minimal_detail, flat_shaded_3d, bold_lines, fear, danger",
