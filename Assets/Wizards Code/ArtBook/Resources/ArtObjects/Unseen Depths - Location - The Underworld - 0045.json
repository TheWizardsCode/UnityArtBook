  "Prompt": "\"A massive underground cavern stretches infinitely into the distance, its dark expanse illuminated by a few scattered, flickering neon lights. The air is thick with ominous, swirling mist. Towering, twisted metallic structures rise from the ground, covered in glowing, bioluminescent vines. Hovering drones with red, menacing eyes patrol the area, casting eerie shadows on the cavern walls. The ground is uneven, littered with abandoned high-tech machinery and rusty remnants of previous explorations, hinting at the dangers that lie within. The color palette consists of dark, muted tones with sporadic bursts of neon blue and green. The atmosphere is heavy, filled with an unsettling silence broken only by the occasional hum of the drones. The image is rendered in flat-shaded 3D digital art, characterized by bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the sheer scale and menacing nature of the underworld.
