  "Prompt": "A vast underground cavern dominated by sleek, metallic structures with an eerie, otherworldly glow. The primary light source is bioluminescent veins running along the cavern walls, casting sinister flickers of green and blue light, bouncing off the metallic surfaces. Huge, ominous machines, with intricate gears and tubes, occupy the left side of the scene, seemingly ancient yet advanced. The ground is uneven with patches of glowing moss and jagged rocks. A haunting, shrill mist seeps from the crevices of the cavern, creating an ethereal, mysterious atmosphere. The right side reveals a deep abyss with robotic tentacles emerging from the darkness, adding an element of danger and unpredictability. Shadows are deep with strong contrasts, leaving parts of the cavern hidden and adding to the sense of trepidation. The entire scene maintains a simple flat shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal details, creating a foreboding and alien environment.
