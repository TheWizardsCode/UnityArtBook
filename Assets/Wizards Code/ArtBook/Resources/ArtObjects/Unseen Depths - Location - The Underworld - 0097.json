  "Prompt": "A vast, eerie sci-fi underground lair. The setting is a massive cavern, with tall jagged rock formations and dark metallic structures rising from the ground. Dim, ominous blue and red lights cast uneven, flickering shadows across the terrain, creating an unsettling atmosphere. The ground is a mix of craggy rocks and twisted, artificial structures, some of which emit a faint, eerie glow. In the background, vague shapes of machinery and alien architecture hint at an ancient, forgotten technology. Hidden among the shadows are sinister, glowing eyes peering out, giving a feeling of constant surveillance. The cavern ceiling is barely visible, obscured by thick, swirling mist illuminated by occasional bursts of electric sparks. Floating platforms and suspended pathways crisscross the space, leading to dark, unreachable alcoves. The overall art style is minimalist, with flat shading and exaggerated bold lines, creating a stark, high-contrast look that enhances the sense of fear and danger.
