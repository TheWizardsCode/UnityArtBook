  "Prompt": "A vast, eerie landscape stretches before the viewer. The scene is set in the heart of the Underworld, a dimly-lit, sci-fi dystopian environment. The ground is a mix of rugged, jagged terrain and smooth, mechanical surfaces, with large cracks emitting a faint, eerie glow. In the background, immense metallic structures emerge from the darkness, their surfaces etched with intricate, pulsating lights resembling technological veins. \n\nTo the left, a gigantic, decrepit industrial facility looms, its once-gleaming bulkheads now rusted and stained. Dark, ominous shadows stretch from its numerous vents and pipelines, giving hints of the labyrinthine tunnels within. Hanging artificially crafted stalactites, adorned with flickering lights, descend from the cavernous ceiling far above.\n\nHovering nearby are several sinister-looking drones, their slick, black surfaces reflecting the sparse light. They move with calculated precision, casting elongated shadows that deepen the sense of foreboding. To the right, a mysterious, fog-shrouded chasm descends into the abyss, its depths unknown but hinted at by sporadic pulses of red light.\n\nNear the center of the image, a group of shadowy figures with sleek, cybernetic enhancements are cautiously making their way through the treacherous landscape, their forms outlined by the dim, blue emergency lighting. Their expressions are tense, scanning for threats hidden in the oppressive darkness. Above them, the atmospheric sky is barely visible, obscured by dense, swirling clouds of toxic gases.\n\nThe overall palette is dark, with muted greys, blacks, and occasional neon accents from the otherworldly technology. The lighting is sparse and low, casting dark, enveloping shadows and creating a heavy atmosphere of fear and danger. The image quality is exceptionally high, with sharp details and crisp lines, despite the minimalistic shading and limited detail, capturing the haunting essence of this desolate underworld.",
