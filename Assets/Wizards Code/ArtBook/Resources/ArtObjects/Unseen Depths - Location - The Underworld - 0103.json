  "Prompt": "Dark, sprawling underworld city with intricate, labyrinthine architecture and towering, oppressive buildings, with neon signs casting eerie glows. The ground is a mix of futuristic metal and decaying organic matter, and the pathways twist impossibly, defying logical construction. Scattered machinery emits steam and sparks, adding to the foreboding atmosphere. Androids with sinister and sleek designs patrol the area, their glowing red eyes piercing through the darkness. The sky above is a nightmarish mix of storm clouds and flickering electrical storms, with occasional glimpses of a harsh, artificial light piercing through. Shadows are long and exaggerated, and the entire scene is bathed in a cold, metallic color palette with an undercurrent of deep blues and purples. Scanning drones hover silently in the background, and the faint hum of electronic whispers add to the chilling environment. Use tags: large breasts, neon lighting, cyberpunk, android, dark shadows, simple shading, 3D digital art, minimal detail, horror, sci-fi, intricate architecture, winding pathways, oppressive atmosphere.",
