  "Prompt": "A dark, sci-fi landscape sprawling with jagged, metallic structures and twisted mechanical vines that pulse with an eerie, bioluminescent glow. The underworld is a labyrinth of abandoned, post-apocalyptic machinery, half-submerged in a murky, radioactive swamp. Large, menacing gears and rusted, monolithic spires jut out from the ground, creating unsettling silhouettes against a toxic green sky, filled with swirling, dark clouds.\n\nRobotic sentinels with predatory features skulk in the shadows, their red eyes piercing through the darkness. Cybernetic creatures prowl through the mist, their bodies a fusion of metal and organic matter. Occasional sparks and flickering lights emanate from broken energy conduits and malfunctioning holographic displays, casting sporadic, ghostly illuminations that reveal parts of the underworld in unsettling snapshots.\n\nA colossal, ancient gateway of twisted metal and alien symbols looms in the distance, guarded by a hulking, mechanoid behemoth, partially submerged in the ooze. Strange, arcane machinery, covered in vines and dripping with dark, oily substances, lies half-hidden, hinting at forgotten, sinister technologies.\n\nScattered throughout are wreckages of otherworldly spacecraft, their innards exposed and corroded, emitting faint, ominous hums. Alien fungal growths glow faintly in the periphery, adding an otherworldly bioluminescence that contrasts sharply against the otherwise desaturated, muted tones of decay and dilapidation.\n\nLighting levels are deliberately low, creating pitch-black shadows and largely unseen areas, conveying a sense of perpetual dusk. The 3D digital art style is flat shaded, using bold lines and minimal detail, amplifying the stark, foreboding atmosphere of this underworld dystopia.
