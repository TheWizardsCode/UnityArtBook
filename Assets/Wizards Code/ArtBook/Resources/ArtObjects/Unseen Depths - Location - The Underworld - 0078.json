  "Prompt": "The image portrays a vast underground chamber, known as \"The Underworld,\" suffused with an eerie, low-level blue luminescence. Stalactites and stalagmites of strange, alien geometries jut prominently from the ground and ceiling, casting elongated, menacing shadows. The walls are composed of metallic surfaces and pulsating, bioluminescent segments. The ground is covered in an uneven terrain of rocks and peculiar, softly glowing fungi.\n\nIn the center, a massive, biomechanical gateway arches ominously, its surface adorned with intricate circuitry and glowing red symbols. Towering mechanical guards with sleek, insect-like forms and single glaring ocular sensors stand vigilantly on either side of the gate, poised in menacing stances. In the background, barely discernible machinery hums and clicks, hinting at the unseen, foreboding depths beyond.\n\nHanging from the ceiling, luminescent cables emit a dim, ghostly light that barely illuminates the surroundings, adding to the atmosphere of dread. The image is rendered in a simple flat shaded 3D digital style, with bold, stark lines and minimal detail, enhancing the sense of menace and fear through its simplicity. The high quality of the image ensures sharp lines and clear contrasts, making every shadow and glow feel palpable and engaging.",
