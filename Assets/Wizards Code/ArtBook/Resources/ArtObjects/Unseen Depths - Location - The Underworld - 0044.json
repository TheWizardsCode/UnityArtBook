  "Prompt": "A dark, dystopian sci-fi underworld, set in a massive, industrial labyrinth bathed in eerie, low-light environments, casting deep shadows and tension. The scene is dominated by giant, rusted mechanical structures and tangled pipelines running across the ceiling and walls. The ground is littered with debris, broken machinery, and puddles of unknown liquid reflecting the sparse, flickering overhead lights. The architecture is cold and angular, with brutalist, oppressive elements.\n\nIn the background, enormous metal skyscrapers pierce through the smog, their tops fading into the darkness. Dangerous-looking drones hover menacingly, with glowing red eyes scanning for intruders. There are platforms and catwalks strung with chains and cables, with occasional sparks from exposed wires creating brief flashes of light. The atmosphere is filled with mist and smoke, adding to the obscured, ominous feeling.\n\nThe setting includes scattered, makeshift shelters where figures in ragged, futuristic clothing can be seen, their faces partially hidden in the shadows. These inhabitants give off an aura of desperation and alertness. Various cybernetic enhancements and glowing implants on these figures reflect the scarce light, hinting at advanced but haphazard technology.\n\nOverall, the flat-shaded 3D digital art style simplifies forms into bold lines and shapes, while maintaining a high quality with clean, precise rendering and sharp contrasts between light and dark areas, emphasizing the foreboding and dangerous atmosphere.",
