  "Prompt": "A haunting and eerie sci-fi scene depicting the underworld, where a vast labyrinth of metallic tunnels and chambers stretches infinitely in every direction. The walls are adorned with strange, glowing alien symbols and bioluminescent fungi that cast an eerie, greenish glow. Large, ominous pipes with liquid seeping out line the walls, giving a sense of decay and danger. The floor is wet with a mysterious, reflective liquid that shows distorted reflections of the surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, a dark, hooded figure with glowing red eyes stands, half-concealed in the shadows. Mechanical limbs and wires protrude from its cloak, giving it a cyborg appearance. The figure's menacing presence suggests it is a sentinel guarding the area.\n\nIn the background, massive, rusty gears slowly turn, creating a grinding sound that adds to the unsettling atmosphere. Dark shadows move within the recesses of the machinery, hinting at unseen creatures lurking just out of sight. The far end of the tunnel fades into complete darkness, leaving a sense of mystery and endless danger.\n\nThe image is rendered in high-quality, flat shaded 3D digital art with bold lines, giving it a minimalist yet impactful appearance. The overall lighting is low, with stark contrasts between the glowing elements and the dark shadows, heightening the sense of fear and uncertainty. Acidic colors punctuate the darkness, and the soft light sources create an otherworldly ambiance. The attention to detail on the textures and the interplay of light and shadow convey a palpable sense of dread.",
