  "Prompt": "A vast, eerie sci-fi underworld cavern with jagged rock formations and an ominous atmosphere. The ground is uneven, filled with treacherous pits and unsettlingly deep chasms that emit an otherworldly glow. Massive, shadowy structures rise from the landscape, their surfaces smooth and reflective, resembling alien architecture. Strange, bioluminescent fungi sporadically dot the terrain, casting an eerie greenish-blue light that barely penetrates the surrounding darkness. Thick, dark fog rolls through the scene, obscuring visibility and heightening the sense of dread.\n\nCrisscrossing the space, there are narrow, precarious bridges made of a mysterious metal alloy, some of which appear partially dismantled or fragile. Gigantic, spider-like mechanical constructs patrol the area, with glowing red eyes and twitching appendages, evoking a sense of imminent threat. In the background, colossal machines hum and whir, their purpose unknown but undoubtedly nefarious.\n\nHigh contrast between the deep shadows and the scarce light sources contributes to the foreboding mood. Sleek, minimal futuristic designs with sharp angles and a predominance of dark, muted colors characterize the environment. The image quality is high, featureing crisp lines and well-defined forms, with the flat shading technique emphasizing the stark, menacing simplicity of the underworld realm.
