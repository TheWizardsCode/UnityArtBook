  "Prompt": "Detailed image prompt: \n\nThe scene depicts \"The Underworld,\" a sci-fi location filled with a sense of fear and danger. The landscape consists of a vast, dark cavern with massive, jagged rock formations and bioluminescent fungi providing faint, eerie lighting. Shadowy, mechanical tendrils reminiscent of futuristic alien technology snake through the cavern, connected to massive, rusted metal structures. Pools of glowing, toxic waste are scattered throughout, casting a sickly green hue. The ground is textured with cracked, uneven surfaces and scattered debris, giving an impression of decay and neglect. A shadowy, indistinct figure with glowing red eyes lurks in the background, barely visible through the darkness and fog. The entire composition is made using simple flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the oppressive atmosphere and the sense of lurking danger. The lighting is low, casting long, deep shadows and leaving many areas concealed in darkness. \n\nTags: dark_cavern, biomechanical_tendrils, glowing_fungi, toxic_waste, rusted_metal_structures, eerie_lighting, shadowy_figure, glowing_red_eyes, 3D_flat_shaded_art, sci-fi_environment, minimal_detail",
