  "Prompt": "A vast, dark underworld with a maze-like network of industrial structures. In the foreground, tall metallic pillars draped with bioluminescent cables that faintly light the surroundings, casting eerie, elongated shadows. The ground is a blend of rust and rugged terrain, dotted with sporadic pools of glowing cyan liquid. There are hints of advanced machinery and large power generators with dim, pulsating lights. In the background, massive, ominous silhouettes of high-tech monolithic buildings stretch upwards, with some areas obscured by thick, dark mist. Suspended platforms and walkways crisscross the scene, connected by thick chains, some of which are broken, hanging precariously. The skies above are predominantly dark, with occasional flickers of lightning illuminating distant, towering spires that rise from the abyss. The entire ambiance exudes a sense of abandonment, danger, and unease. Tags: 3D, digital_art, industrial, sci-fi, dark_shadows, bioluminescent, eerie, machinery, ominous, high_tech",
