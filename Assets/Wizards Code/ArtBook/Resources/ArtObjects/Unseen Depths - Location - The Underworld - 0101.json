  "Prompt": "A sprawling, high-tech underworld city sprawls beneath a massive cavernous ceiling, lit dimly by eerie, artificial lights embedded in the walls. The skyline is jagged with towering, monolithic structures that emit a dull, mechanical hum. Dark, narrow alleys snake through the cityscape, with flickering neon signs casting ominous glows. Robotic sentinels patrol the shadowed streets, their red eyes piercing through the darkness. Crumbling infrastructure juts out at odd angles, with rust and decay evident on every surface. Hovering transport pods navigate through the maze-like architecture, disappearing into shadowy depths. The ground is littered with mechanical debris and smoking vents, adding a sense of decay and danger. The cavern ceiling above is barely visible, shrouded in darkness, with tangled cables and pipes hanging down. Sparse vegetation struggles to survive in this harsh environment, with bioluminescent plants providing faint glows in secluded corners. The entire scene is rendered in simple, flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines, minimal detail, and low lighting levels, creating dark shadows and many unseen, threatening areas.
