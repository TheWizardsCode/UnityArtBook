  "Prompt": ">An eerie, sci-fi underworld scene dominated by dark, murky hues and heavy shadows. The environment appears cavernous and otherworldly, with a network of jagged, metallic structures jutting out from the walls and ceiling at bizarre angles. The ground surface is uneven, composed of cracked, rusted metal plates with occasional glowing neon blue fissures running through them. Scattered across the scene are mysterious, cylindrical artifacts with blinking red lights, suggesting they might be alive or monitored. In the background, shadowy monolithic structures loom ominously, their surfaces covered with strange, luminescent alien glyphs. A thick mist swirls through the air, diffusing the dim, flickering industrial lights that sporadically accentuate the scene. Visuals of advanced technology in decay - broken screens, disconnected cables sparking with electricity, and defunct, spider-like robot carcasses strewn about â€“ add a sense of abandonment and dread. The atmosphere feels oppressive, the silence occasionally broken by the distant mechanical groans and eerie echoes with low lighting casting long, sinister shadows. The use of flat shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail heightens the tension, inviting viewers to imagine dangers lurking in the unseen areas. \n\nTags: dark_background, metallic_surfaces, neon_glow, sci-fi_underworld, eerie_setting, abandoned_technology, low_lighting, atmospheric_mist, alien_glyphs.",
