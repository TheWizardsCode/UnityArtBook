  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding cavern stretches out into the distance, with jagged, uneven walls that suggest the place is unstable and could collapse at any moment. The lighting is minimal, casting deep shadows and creating a sense of the unknown lurking just beyond the visible areas. At the far end, there is a glowing portal emitting neon blue light, surrounded by complex machinery with exposed wires, pipes, and metallic panels. The ground is uneven, covered in a dark, oily substance that reflects what little light exists. Sparse, eerie bioluminescent plants dot the cavern, casting a faint, greenish hue. In the foreground, there are remnants of what looks like advanced technologyâ€”broken robots and digital screens flickering sporadically. The entire scene feels like a dangerous, uncharted territory with an overwhelming sense of fear and imminent peril. The image uses a simple, flat-shaded 3D art style with bold, pronounced lines and minimal detail, making the viewer focus on the unsettling atmosphere and the mysterious elements within the cavern.",
