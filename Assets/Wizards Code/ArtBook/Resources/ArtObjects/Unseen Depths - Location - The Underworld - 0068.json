  "Prompt": "An immense cavernous underground setting filled with towering, jagged rock formations, a dim, eerie greenish glow casting just enough light to reveal the treacherous terrain. The ground is rugged and uneven, with patches of sinister, bioluminescent fungi scattered across the rocky floor. Enormous machinery with flickering lights and corroded metal pipes entwined throughout the cavern, indicating some abandoned industrial facility taken over by the underworldâ€™s organic elements. Stalactites hang from the ceiling like sharp, menacing teeth, and deep chasms of darkness suggest uncharted depths below. Strange, twisted alien flora with pulsating veins glow faintly amidst the shadows, contributing to the alien atmosphere. The entire scene is depicted in a 3D flat-shaded digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing stark contrasts between light and dark, and enhancing the sense of fear and mystery.
