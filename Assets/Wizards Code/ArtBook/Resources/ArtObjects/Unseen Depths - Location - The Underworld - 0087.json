  "Prompt": "A dark, eerie sci-fi underworld with extensive interconnected tunnels and caverns, illuminated by an ominous crimson glow emanating from unknown sources within the cave walls. Jagged, angular rock formations loom overhead and jut out from the ground, creating a labyrinthine landscape filled with treacherous pathways. The air appears thick and heavy, with a faint fog adding to the suffocating atmosphere. Strange, bioluminescent plants cast a ghostly light, their alien shapes twisted and unnerving. Occasional high-tech relics and derelict machinery are half-buried in the ground, covered in rust and organic growths, suggesting a forgotten civilization. The whole scene is devoid of life, but there is an unsettling feeling of being watched, as if the shadows themselves are alive. The overall composition is flat shaded 3D digital art with bold lines, deep dark shadows, and minimalist detail, focusing on creating an overpowering sense of fear and danger.
