  "Prompt": "\"A sci-fi underworld scene featuring a vast, subterranean cavern filled with eerie, bioluminescent fungi casting a faint, ghostly glow in the low-light environment. The landscape is dominated by jagged, metallic structures protruding from the cavern walls, reminiscent of alien architecture. Pools of luminescent liquid create an ominous reflection, out-of-place artefacts scattered around hinting at a long-gone civilization. In the foreground, a lone, heavily armored figure with a futuristic exosuit cautiously navigates the treacherous terrain, their form outlined starkly against the shadowy backdrop. Mechanical drones hover silently nearby, casting surveillance beams that create stark contrasts of light and dark. Mysterious shadows hint at unseen creatures lurking in the depths, adding to the atmosphere of fear and danger. The overall aesthetic is defined by flat, shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal details, emphasizing the haunting simplicity of the underworld.
