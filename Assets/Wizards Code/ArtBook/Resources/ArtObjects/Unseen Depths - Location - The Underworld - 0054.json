  "Prompt": "A vast, eerie expanse under a dimly lit alien landscape. Sharp, angular rock formations jut out of the ground, casting long, sinister shadows. A dark, swirling abyss stretches across the center, emitting an ominous glow. Strange, mechanical structures of dubious purpose dot the terrain, with flickering, malfunctioning lights that create an unsettling atmosphere. In the background, enormous, smooth stone arches loom, eerily lit by a hidden, ethereal light source that barely pierces the darkness. Cracked surfaces and deep crevices hint at the instability and ancient age of the place. Various bizarre, robotic creatures skulk in the shadows, their glowing eyes piercing the murk. The color palette is dominated by deep blacks, muted grays, and the occasional sickly green or eerie purple glow. The high-quality image has smooth, polished surfaces with reflections that enhance the depth and unsettling nature of the scene.
