  "Prompt": "A sprawling, eerie cavern stretches infinitely into the darkness, its ceiling adorned with glowing, bioluminescent plants casting an ominous green light. Metallic structures, jagged and decayed, rise from the ground, indicating a long-abandoned alien civilization. Robotic guardians, rusted and half-functional, patrol the area, their eyes emitting a faint, menacing red glow. In the foreground, an ominous portal emanates a deep, swirling purple energy, hinting at an unknown terror beyond. Shadowy figures lurk in the background, their forms indistinct yet inherently threating. The ground is littered with debris and remnants of past conflicts, while strange, elongated shadows dance across the scene. The minimalistic, flat-shaded 3D style with bold lines ensures clarity yet maintains a haunting simplicity, adding to the atmosphere of danger and fear. #sci-fi #underworld #abandoned #alien #green_glow #robotic_guardians #ominous_portal #shadowy_figures #minimalistic_style #dark_shadows #3D_digital_art",
