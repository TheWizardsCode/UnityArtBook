  "Prompt": "A vast, dark cavern stretches out, with rugged, jagged rock formations jutting out at bizarre angles, illuminated minimally by an eerie, bioluminescent green glow emanating from mysterious, otherworldly fungi scattered across the cavern floor. Lurking in the shadows are menacing creatures with sleek, shiny exoskeletons, their multi-faceted eyes reflecting the minimal light, hinting at their predatory nature. Rusted, abandoned high-tech machinery lies half-buried in the rock, showing signs of past human presence and needless risk. Electric-blue veins of unknown energy course through transparent tubes embedded in the rock walls, pulsating with a rhythmic yet ominous hum. Small pools of viscous, black liquid intermittently ripple as if disturbed by unseen entities beneath the surface. The atmosphere is heavy and oppressive, compounded by the low-frequency hum of the machinery and the distant, sporadic echoes of the cavernâ€™s unseen perils. The overall composition is rendered in flat shaded 3D digital art, characterized by bold lines and minimal detail, intensifying the feeling of foreboding and leaving much of the scene's danger to the viewer's imagination.
