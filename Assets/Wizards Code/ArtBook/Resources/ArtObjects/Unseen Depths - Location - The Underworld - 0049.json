  "Prompt": "A dark, eerie landscape unfolds before us, dominated by an oppressive, cavernous expanse deep within the underworld. Jagged rock formations jut out from all surfaces, illuminated intermittently by small, bioluminescent fungi that scatter faint, ghostly glows. The terrain is rugged and uneven, with deep chasms cutting through the ground, hinting at unseen depths below. \n\nThe architecture is dystopian and alien, with towering metallic structures that appear worn and corroded. The surfaces are covered in a grimy patina, reflecting the dim light in a cold, unsettling manner. Rusted pipes and conduits snake around the scene like metallic vines, emitting occasional bursts of steam. \n\nSuspended, dilapidated platforms and bridges crisscross the environment, constructed from a mixture of alien technology and salvaged materials. Flickering, neon-hued lights occasionally pierce the shadows, giving a brief view of dangerous drops and precarious walkways. Strange, dark fluid flows in narrow streams along the ground, reflecting the sparse ambient light, adding a sense of toxicity and danger.\n\nIn the distance, vague mechanical movements can be seen, suggesting massive, unseen machinery operating quietly in the dark, and faint, menacing sounds echo through the cavern. Shadows move within the darker recesses, hinting at lurking creatures or unknown threats. The entire scene is rendered in simple flat shaded 3D digital art, with bold, clean lines defining the minimalistic yet evocative detailing, enhancing the stark, foreboding atmosphere.\n\nTags: {underworld, dark, cavern, sci-fi, dystopian, alien architecture, bioluminescent fungi, eerie, fear, danger, shadows, minimalistic, flat shaded, 3D digital art, bold lines, high quality, highres}.",
