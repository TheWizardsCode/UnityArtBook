  "Prompt": "dark, cavernous underworld environment, featuring towering jagged rock formations illuminated by the faint glow of luminescent fungi. slick, glossy surfaces reflect sporadic light sources, creating eerie shadows and unseen lurking dangers. high-tech alien machinery is partially buried in walls, emitting faint electric hums and flickering lights. biomechanical creatures with twisted, serpentine bodies and glowing eyes crawl on the rocks. deep crevices hide unknown threats, exaggerated by the minimal detail and dark shading. phosphorescent plants and strange liquid pools add an otherworldly illumination, concentrating the viewer's attention on the few lit areas. complex machinery sounds are emitted from obscure corners, indicating presence of unknown entities. heavy use of bold lines and flat shading create a sense of simplicity while adding to the ominous feel. quality akin to high-resolution; every pixel is crisp, with attention to light and shadow enhancing the sense of depth and danger. tags: dark, cavern, sci-fi, luminescent, fungi, alien, machinery, biomechanical, serpentine, phosphorescent, minimal detail, flat shading, bold lines, high resolution.",
