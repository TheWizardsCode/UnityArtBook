  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding underworld with intricate bioluminescent fungi casting eerie glows across the barren landscape. The cavernous environment sprawls with jagged, metallic structures that rise ominously from the ground, their sharp edges hinting at unknown dangers. The walls are adorned with high-tech machinery, intertwined with pulsating tubes that seem almost alive. Pools of stagnant, glowing liquid reflect the minimal light, suggesting toxic hazards. Occasional bursts of steam vent from cracks in the uneven metallic floor. Salvaged parts and debris float in a low-gravity field, adding to the chaotic ambiance. The entire scene is wrapped in shadows, with only the faint luminescence from the fungi providing minimal visibility, enhancing the mysterious and dangerous atmosphere. The simplistic, flat-shaded, 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail emphasizes the bleak, sci-fi aesthetic.
