  "Prompt": "In the dimly lit depths of the sci-fi underworld, chilling shadows dominate the environment, laced with a sense of fear and impending danger. The scene unfolds in a vast, cavernous space, with sleek, modern machinery juxtaposed against raw, jagged rock formations. Mysterious, imposing silhouettes of futuristic structures loom in the background, their sharp angles and geometric designs casting ominous shadows. The few light sources are harsh and strategic, creating sharp contrasts and deep, impenetrable darkness in the recesses.\n\nBright, striking colors of red, orange, and yellow highlight the machinery and textiles scattered throughout. Intricate, glowing control panels and screens pulse with life, infused with a sinister energy. The ground is a tangled web of pipes and cables, some sparking and emitting small plumes of smoke, adding to the chaotic and perilous atmosphere. Occasional flickers of neon lights reflect off metallic surfaces, adding to the eerie ambiance. \n\nFigures clad in dark, sleek bodysuits with glowing visors navigate the treacherous terrain, their movements cautious and deliberate. Their forms are starkly contrasting, their presence heightening the tension of the scene. The composition utilizes a simple, flat-shaded 3D digital art style with bold lines and minimal detail, providing clarity and focus to the essential elements while amplifying the sense of unease and threat. The environment feels both alien and industrial, a nightmarish blend of advanced technology and primal fear.",
