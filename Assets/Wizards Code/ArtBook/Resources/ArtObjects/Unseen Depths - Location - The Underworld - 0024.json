  "Prompt": "The scene is a vast, foreboding underground cavern with jagged rock formations towering menacingly. The cavern is illuminated sporadically by eerie, bioluminescent fungi casting a dim, eerie glow. Suspended stalactites hang like deadly daggers from the arched ceiling. The ground is a mixture of sharp rocks and toxic, glowing pools of greenish liquid, clearly hazardous.\n\nIn the distance, towering mechanical structures and labyrinthine networks of metallic walkways crisscross above the cavern floor, hinting at an advanced but abandoned civilization. Rusted pipes and cables snake across the ground and up the walls, some of them sparking with errant electrical discharges. Strange, alien machinery can be seen, half-buried in rubble, with cryptic glyphs glowing faintly on their surfaces.\n\nJagged, angular shadows create an atmosphere of unease, masking much of the cavern in darkness. The lighting is minimal, coming from occasional flickers of malfunctioning machinery or the pulsating luminescence of alien flora. The flat-shaded 3D digital art style emphasizes clean, bold lines with minimal details, adding to the stark and oppressive atmosphere.\n\nTags: low lighting, cavern, sci-fi, alien environment, mechanical structures, bioluminescent fungi, toxic liquid, eerie, abandoned civilization, rusted machinery, dark shadows, unseen areas, flat shaded, 3D digital art, bold lines.",
