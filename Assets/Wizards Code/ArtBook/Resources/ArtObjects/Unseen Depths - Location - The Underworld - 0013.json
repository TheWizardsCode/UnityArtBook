  "Prompt": "A vast, sprawling underground city, industrial and alien in design, stretches out in a massive cavern illuminated by sporadic, eerie lighting. Dark shadows and unseen areas contribute to an overwhelming sense of fear and danger. The architecture is dominated by towering metallic structures and sprawling pipelines, all meticulously organized yet inherently chaotic. Red, orange, and yellow neon lights and markings highlight various machinery and textiles, lending an ominous glow to the otherwise gloomy environment. The cityâ€™s inhabitants, shadowy and indistinct, appear as dark silhouettes, enhancing the sense of unease. Advanced, towering machines with complex robotic appendages move with precise, almost threatening movements. Heavy metallic doors, adorned with cryptic, illuminated symbols, line the cavern walls. Advanced transport tubes and dilapidated vehicles, glowing with the same striking colors, hint at a bustling yet perilous society. The aesthetic is distinctly flat-shaded 3D digital art, characterized by bold lines that sharply define each element, contrasting with the minimal detail of the dark, cavernous surroundings. Gelbooru tags: 3d, digital_art, dark_shadows, neon_lights, industrial, sci-fi, futuristic_city, fear, danger, stark_contrast, flat_shading, bold_lines.",
