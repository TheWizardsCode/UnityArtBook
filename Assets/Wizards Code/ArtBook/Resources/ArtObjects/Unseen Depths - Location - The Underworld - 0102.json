  "Prompt": "Futuristic subterranean world, the underworld is set in a vast, sprawling network of metallic caverns and tunnels illuminated by eerie, glowing red and blue neon lights. Jagged, rusted metal walls tower on all sides, covered in mysterious alien symbols and graffiti. The ground is uneven, littered with twisted metal debris and broken machinery emitting faint, sporadic sparks. Dark, thick fog rolls along the floor, partially obscuring dangerous pits and hidden traps. Above, massive industrial pipes and ducts run like chaotic veins, occasionally dripping unknown liquids. In the distance, glowing eyes of strange robotic creatures peer out from the darkness, their glossy, reflective surfaces catching the neon lighting. The atmosphere is dense with tension and danger, echoing with distant mechanical hums and unsettling, echoing noises. The visual style is simple flat shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark, foreboding environment and the fear of the unknown. The overall tone is dark, oppressive, and otherworldly, invoking an uneasy sense of dread and danger. \n\nTags: dark_shadows, low_lighting, eerie, neon_glow, metallic_caverns, alien_symbols, broken_machinery, industrial_pipes, robotic_creatures, minimal_detail, flat_shaded, 3d_art, fear, tension.",
