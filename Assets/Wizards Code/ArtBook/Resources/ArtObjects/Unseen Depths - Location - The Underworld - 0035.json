  "Prompt": "A dimly lit, cavernous underground landscape of a foreboding alien world. The jagged rock formations and twisted metal structures are illuminated by a faint, eerie green glow emanating from bioluminescent fungi growing sporadically along the cavern walls. Narrow walkways and bridges made of an unknown alloy span across a vast chasm, with mist-like fog rolling through the air. The distant sounds of mechanical drones and unexplained echoes add to the sense of dread. A central ominous structure, resembling a colossal, deactivated machine with intricate gears and cables, looms in the background. Pools of unknown liquid, glowing softly, reflect the scarce light creating an unsettling atmosphere. Shadows are deep, and unseen areas hint at lurking dangers. Alien runes and symbols line the walls, hinting at an ancient, forgotten technology. The 3D digital art style is characterized by flat shading, bold lines, and minimal detail, ensuring a clear yet haunting visual.
