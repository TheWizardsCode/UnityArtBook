  "Prompt": "The image portrays a vast, cavernous sci-fi underworld. High-tech structures and machinery, partly eroded and overtaken by bioluminescent flora, dominate the scene. Dark shadows and unseen recesses create an air of mystery and danger, with occasional flickers of dim, cold light from malfunctioning equipment. A sprawling network of pipes and wiring runs haphazardly across the environment. In the background, towering, vaguely humanoid figures loom, seemingly constructed of both organic and metallic elements, their glowing red eyes piercing through the gloom. The ground is uneven and littered with debris, glowing fungi, and toxic puddles emitting noxious vapors. Unseen creatures skitter in the shadows, only their glowing eyes visible. The entire scene is rendered in a simple, flat-shaded 3D style with bold, sharp lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the eeriness and intricacy of this alien underworld. The low lighting enhances the sense of fear and uncertainty, creating an oppressive and foreboding atmosphere.
