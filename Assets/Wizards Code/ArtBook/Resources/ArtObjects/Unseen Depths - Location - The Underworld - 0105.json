  "Prompt": "A vast, dark expanse underground, filled with jagged, alien rock formations illuminated by a distant, eerie bioluminescent glow coming from cracks in the ground and walls. The cavern is filled with a dense, swirling mist that gives the scene an ominous and mysterious atmosphere. Strange, futuristic-looking machines and structures, half-buried in the rocky terrain, hint at an ancient, forgotten technology. A river of liquid metal flows slowly through the scene, casting faint reflections. Sparse vegetation, like twisted, metallic vines, reaches out from the rock edges, glowing faintly. The lighting is dim with harsh shadows, adding an ominous feel to the scene. The overall art style consists of simple, flat-shaded 3D digital art with bold lines and minimal detail, emphasizing the stark, eerie environment.
