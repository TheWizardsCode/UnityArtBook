  "Prompt": "A dark, foreboding sci-fi underworld built within an expansive underground cavern. The cavern ceiling is jagged and uneven, suggesting natural formation, while various artificial structures blend seamlessly into the stone. Neon lights scattered sparsely, their glow casting eerie reflections on the metallic surfaces of the structures. Suspended bridges and walkways connect multiple levels, all appearing precarious and ill-maintained. The ground terrain is uneven, with large, looming limestone columns and strange alien flora giving an otherworldly feel. Occasional pools of glowing, luminescent liquid dot the landscape. \n\nSilhouetted against the dim lighting, featureless humanoid figures can be seen lurking, creating an ominous presence. The primary color scheme includes deep blues and dark purples, with neon greens and reds providing stark contrasts. The environment is mostly static but with minor animated elements like subtle movements of shadows and flickering neon signs. Despite the simple, flat-shaded 3D digital art style, the image invokes a profound fear and danger through its use of bold lines and minimal details, making every unseen area feel like a potential threat. gelbooru_tags: \"3D, scifi, underworld, dark, high_quality, digital_art, bold_lines, minimal_detail, fear, danger, neon_lights, cavern, structures, humanoid_figures, shadows, alien_flora, luminescent_liquid, suspended_bridges, eerie, glowingReflections, simpleFlatShadedArt\"",
